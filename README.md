# Restaurant Management System

## Project Overview
This is my Go project for the programming language course. It's a restaurant management system backend that handles restaurants, tables, menus, events, and users.

The system lets restaurant managers add their restaurants to the platform, create sections inside each restaurant, add tables with QR codes, and manage special events. Users can view restaurant info and book tables for events.
